/*
 * You have planned some train traveling one year in advance. The days of the year in which you will travel are given 
 * as an integer array days. Each day is an integer from 1 to 365.
 * Train tickets are sold in three different ways:
 * a 1-day pass is sold for costs[0] dollars,
 * a 7-day pass is sold for costs[1] dollars, and
 * a 30-day pass is sold for costs[2] dollars.
 * The passes allow that many days of consecutive travel.
 * For example, if we get a 7-day pass on day 2, then we can travel for 7 days: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
 * Return the minimum number of dollars you need to travel every day in the given list of days.
